Sales forcasting for bicycle tire sales
-David Dam - Jae Park - Louis Cheng -

Dataset:
Records of tire sales spaning 5-6 year.


Quesions

- Has there been a significant difference in overall sales quantity compared to expected projections?
- Has there been a significant change in the type of application?
- Compare Mountain to other categories
- Has there been a significant change in the most popular tire sizes?
- How did COVID affect bicycle tire sales in 2020 and beyond?

Hypothesis: 
If there is a global pandemic that prevents people from doing indoor activities 
then there will be an increase in outdoor recreational activities. 
Of which we can measure via bicycle tire sales as a consumable.

Analysis: 


- Has there been a significant difference in overall sales quantity compared to expected projections?

If we "Forecasted Quantity by Month.png" , the year leading up to 2020 were simiar and 2020 was forcasted to be the same. However,
if we follow the historical data then we see a large spike more than doubling the next highest year in our dataset. Then slowly tapering off the next year.

- Has there been a significant change in the type of application? Compare Mountain to other categories.

As seen in "Invoiced Quantity vs Application over the years.png" While the amount of purchases remained increased. The purchase ration by application did not change.
Mountain bike tires remain the best sellers with Urban coming in second.

- Has there been a significant change in the most popular tire sizes?

As seen in the figure "Year vs invoiced Quantity.png", Examining the historical data. 
The years prior to 2020 26, 27.5 and 29 had similary and constant popularity. However, as we get into 2020, 
29" continues to increase while 26 and 27.5 continue to decreas. In 2020 there is a spike in purchases for 29" tires. 
From this we can dicern that there was a shift in popularity of the size of the tire. 
While 26 and 27.5 and 29 where roughly equaly as popular in the past. 29" has become the most popular tire by far.

- How did COVID affect bicycle tire sales in 2020 and beyond?

Examining all the data and the charts it is clear that COVID had a clear impact on bicycle tire sales. 
While sale tended to remain the same through out historical data. In 2020 when covid was at its peak,
sale skyrocketed to more the triple the previous year. 

Conclusion:

In conclusion, we can clearly say that our hyposis was proven correct. The drastic reduction of options for indoor entertainment 
had cause a major increase outdoor entertainment thus a increase in sales of outdoor recreational equipment.

Hypothesis: 
If there is a global pandemic that prevents people from doing indoor activities 
then there will be an increase in outdoor recreational activities.
